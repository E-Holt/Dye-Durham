## Dye & Durham Codeing Assessment

Thank you for viewing this coding assessment. I have written this in JavaScript using Node.js and Jest for testing. 

<br/>

### Running the Sorting Program
To run the script you must have node intalled, as long as the unsorted-names-list.txt is added to this repository the name-sorter.js file it should run with the following command from the terminal when in the repository:
```
  node name-sorter.js  
```
<br/>

### Running the Test
To run the test, npm and jest must be installed. 
The test can be run from the terminal with the following command:
```
  npm test
```

Whoever is reviewing this likely knows all of this, I just wanted to show I can create a basic Markdown document. 

Thank you for your time!
